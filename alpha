Hello Everyone! I'm Director1406 and today I'll give you some stuff on what's happening at SB project.

Today, I"ll be explaining what is going on with the HUB that will be the part of this game.

Recently, I decided that I'm going to make a hub, not just a menu. So, here we go!
Here are some things that you will be able to do in the Hub:

- If you set your graphics to ten, you'll be able to experience a blurry window effect. High speed!!
- You can always practise your shooting skills at Whiteroom (Practice room)
- If you have trouble finding what is where, you can press "i" on your keyboard to enable help.
- You can choose between Story Mode and Online Mode.
- Story mode will have 4 missions and 2 DLC missions (DLC may not be added at all)
- Online mode will have two game types: FFA and Spies V.S Mercs.

P.S. More text files about the project will be released sooner.

Follow us on twitter to keep up with our SB Project! @Director_Dev

Sincerely,

Director1406.
